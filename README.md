# Parsing XML
A sample XML file is parsed and changed the contents using Python.

**Pre-requisites**

Pip install the following libraries:
```
xml.etree.ElementTree
json
xmltodict
sys
```

```testxml.xml``` is the input file with four branches and two sub-branches and in the ```testoutxml.xml``` we remove a branch with a sub-branch and add a different branch.

This program displays each root in the XML file. It even helps convert into a dictionary or JSON 

If need help in using the code, 
type ```Python parsexml.py -h```
